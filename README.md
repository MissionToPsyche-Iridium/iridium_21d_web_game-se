## Project Overview
The **NASA Psyche Mission** is an exciting orbiter mission designed to explore the metal-rich asteroid *Psyche*, located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Launched in October 2023, the spacecraft will arrive at the asteroid in mid-2029. The mission's goal is to study *Psyche* from orbit, gathering valuable data on its composition and history, without landing on its surface.

As part of the public outreach efforts, NASA has a long history of creating engaging web-based games that excite people about space exploration. Our project, **Psyche Web Game**, aims to continue this tradition by developing an interactive and informative game that educates players of all ages about the Psyche mission and space science.

## Project Goal
Our goal is to create a fun, educational, and robust web-based game that captures the excitement of the NASA Psyche mission. The game will allow users to learn about space exploration, asteroids, and the scientific objectives of the Psyche mission, all while enjoying an interactive gameplay experience.

## Features
- **Educational Content**: Learn about the Psyche mission, asteroid exploration, and the importance of space science.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Enjoy a well-designed game that combines entertainment with learning.
- **Target Audience**: Designed for players of all ages, with a focus on making space exploration fun and accessible to everyone.
