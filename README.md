## Project Overview
The **NASA Psyche Mission** is an exciting orbiter mission designed to explore the metal-rich asteroid *Psyche*, located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Launched in October 2023, the spacecraft will arrive at the asteroid in mid-2029. The mission's goal is to study *Psyche* from orbit, gathering valuable data on its composition and history, without landing on its surface.

As part of the public outreach efforts, NASA has a long history of creating engaging web-based games that excite people about space exploration. Our project, **Psyche Web Game**, aims to continue this tradition by developing an interactive and informative game that educates players of all ages about the Psyche mission and space science.

## Project Goal

Our goal is to create a fun, educational, and robust web-based game that captures the excitement of the NASA Psyche mission. The game will allow users to learn about space exploration, asteroids, and the scientific objectives of the Psyche mission, all while enjoying an interactive gameplay experience.

## Features

- **Educational Content**: Learn about the Psyche mission, asteroid exploration, and the importance of space science.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Enjoy a well-designed game that combines entertainment with learning.
- **Target Audience**: Designed for players of all ages, with a focus on making space exploration fun and accessible to everyone.

## Examples of NASA Web-Based Games

We draw inspiration from other successful NASA games, such as:

- [NASA's Space Place](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/menu/play/)
- [Climate Kids](https://climatekids.nasa.gov/menu/play/)
- [SCaN Interactive Games](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/communications/outreach/interactive_games)

## üöÄ NASA Psyche Web-Based Application

This web-based educational game was developed as part of Team #34's final software engineering project. It is inspired by NASA's real Psyche mission and designed to engage students through interactive learning. The game includes five unique mini-games, each targeting a specific learning objective related to the mission, space science, or engineering challenges.

## üéÆ Mini-Games Overview

1. **Clothing Challenge**
   - **Goal**: Teach players about the extreme conditions of space and the protective gear astronauts use.
   - **Gameplay**: Players must correctly dress an astronaut using mission-appropriate gear for protection, simulating real decisions astronauts face.

2. **Jump Through Hoops**
   - **Goal**: Help players understand orbital mechanics and trajectory planning.
   - **Gameplay**: The player controls a spacecraft and must jump through moving rings, simulating orbital alignment and navigation challenges.

3. **Diner Delivery**
   - **Goal**: Demonstrate resource logistics in space missions.
   - **Gameplay**: Players must serve correct food to astronauts based on timed prompts, mimicking the constraints of food supply planning in space travel.

4. **Quiz Game**
   - **Goal**: Reinforce Psyche mission facts and core scientific knowledge.
   - **Gameplay**: Players answer multiple-choice questions of varying difficulty, with a hint option and feedback. This game reinforces learning while testing memory and focus.

5. **Rocket Rhythm**
   - **Goal**: Explore musical patterns and signal timing as metaphors for data transmission and communication in space.
   - **Gameplay**: A rhythm-based game where players must hit notes in time to simulate the precision needed in spacecraft communication.

## üåå Educational Focus

All content was reviewed for scientific accuracy against official NASA Psyche documentation. Each game is designed to be:

- **Informative** ‚Äî Teaching real-world space science topics.
- **Accessible** ‚Äî Keyboard-navigable with colorblind-friendly visuals.
- **Engaging** ‚Äî Game mechanics tailored to younger audiences and educational environments.

## Project Scope

- **Compelling Gameplay**: The game will be designed to capture players' attention and provide them with an enjoyable experience while they learn.
- **Accuracy**: All educational content will be grounded in real scientific data and aligned with the goals of the Psyche mission.
- **Engagement**: The game will encourage players to explore different aspects of the mission and asteroid science through interactive challenges and tasks.
